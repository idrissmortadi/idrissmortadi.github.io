        Exploring the Mandelbrot Fractal: A C++ Project
      </h2>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        In this post, I'll take you through a project where I combined C++ with
        SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) to create a real-time
        Mandelbrot fractal visualizer. The Mandelbrot fractal is a fascinating
        mathematical object that produces intricate and infinitely complex
        patterns. By iterating a simple equation over complex numbers, we can
        visualize the boundary of this fractal, which is often described as "the
        edge of chaos."
        <br /><br />
        The goal of this project was not only to explore the beauty of the
        Mandelbrot set but also to deepen my understanding of C++ by working
        with SFML, a powerful library for handling graphics, windowing, and user
        input. Throughout this guide, I'll explain how I implemented the
        Mandelbrot fractal, rendered it on the screen, and enabled user
        interaction to explore different parts of the fractal in real time.

      <h2>What I Have Learned</h2>
      <p>
        This project provided a deep dive into several important concepts in
        both C++ and computer graphics. Here's what I learned:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Complex Number Manipulation:</strong> Working with complex
          numbers in C++ allowed me to explore how mathematical concepts can be
          directly applied in programming. Understanding how to map pixels to
          points in the complex plane was crucial for generating the Mandelbrot
          fractal.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Graphics Programming with SFML:</strong> SFML proved to be an
          excellent library for handling graphics in C++. I learned how to
          create and manipulate textures, sprites, and views, and how to
          efficiently update the display based on user input.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>User Interaction Handling:</strong> Implementing keyboard
          controls for panning and zooming taught me how to create interactive
          applications. I learned how to process input events in real time and
          update the visual output accordingly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Performance Considerations:</strong> Calculating the
          Mandelbrot set can be computationally intensive. I learned how to
          optimize the rendering process by limiting the number of iterations
          and using efficient data structures to handle pixel data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Memory Management in C++:</strong> Dynamically allocating
          memory for the pixel array and ensuring that it was properly
          deallocated taught me the importance of managing resources in C++ to
          avoid memory leaks.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Overall, this project was a fantastic learning experience that allowed
        me to apply both mathematical concepts and practical programming skills
        to create a visually interesting and interactive application.
      </p>
      <h2>Setting Up the Project</h2>
      <p>
        The first step in the project was to include the necessary libraries and
        define some constants. We used
        <code>#include &lt;SFML/Graphics.hpp&gt;</code> for graphics handling
        and <code>#include &lt;complex&gt;</code> for working with complex
        numbers. The constants defined the window size, color channels (RGBA),
        the maximum number of iterations for the Mandelbrot calculation, and the
        movement and zoom speed.
      </p>

      <pre><code class="language-cpp">#define WIDTH 800
#define HEIGHT 600
#define COLOR_CHANNELS 4 // RGBA
#define MAX_ITER 500
#define MOVE_SPEED 10
#define ZOOM_LEVEL 0.05
</code></pre>

      <h2>Understanding the Mandelbrot Calculation</h2>
      <p>
        The Mandelbrot set is calculated by iterating over each pixel, mapping
        it to a point in the complex plane, and determining if it belongs to the
        set. This is done using the <code>calculateMandelbrot</code> function.
        We initialize each pixel's real and imaginary parts based on its
        position and check if the sequence of values escapes to infinity within
        the maximum number of iterations. The results determine the color of
        each pixel.
      </p>

      <pre><code class="language-cpp">void calculateMandelbrot(sf::Uint8 *pixels, double centerX, double centerY,
                         double X, double Y) {
    double scale_real = X / WIDTH;
    double scale_imag = Y / HEIGHT;

    for (int py = 0; py &lt; HEIGHT; ++py) {
        for (int px = 0; px &lt; WIDTH; ++px) {
            double real = centerX + (px - WIDTH / 2.0) * scale_real;
            double imag = centerY + (py - HEIGHT / 2.0) * scale_imag;

            std::complex&lt;double&gt; c(real, imag);
            std::complex&lt;double&gt; z(0.0, 0.0);
            int iter = 0;

            while (std::abs(z) &lt;= 2.0 && iter &lt; MAX_ITER) {
                z = z * z + c;
                ++iter;
            }

            int pixelIndex = (py * WIDTH + px) * COLOR_CHANNELS;

            if (iter &lt; MAX_ITER) {
                pixels[pixelIndex] = iter % 256; // Red channel
                pixels[pixelIndex + 1] = (iter * 2) % 256; // Green channel
                pixels[pixelIndex + 2] = (iter * 3) % 256; // Blue channel
                pixels[pixelIndex + 3] = 255; // Alpha channel
            } else {
                pixels[pixelIndex] = 0;
                pixels[pixelIndex + 1] = 0;
                pixels[pixelIndex + 2] = 0;
                pixels[pixelIndex + 3] = 255;
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

      <h2>Rendering the Fractal with SFML</h2>
      <p>
        To display the Mandelbrot fractal, we use an SFML texture to hold the
        pixel data and a sprite to render it. The initial setup involves
        creating a pixel array, setting up the texture, and positioning the
        sprite at the center of the window. The <code>sf::RenderWindow</code> is
        used to manage the window where the fractal will be displayed.
      </p>

      <pre><code class="language-cpp">sf::Uint8 *pixels = new sf::Uint8[WIDTH * HEIGHT * COLOR_CHANNELS];
sf::Texture texture;
texture.create(WIDTH, HEIGHT);
texture.update(pixels);

sf::Sprite sprite(texture);
sprite.setOrigin(WIDTH / 2.0, HEIGHT / 2.0);
sf::RenderWindow window(sf::VideoMode(WIDTH, HEIGHT), "Mandelbrot Fractal");
sf::View view;
view.reset(sf::FloatRect(0, 0, WIDTH, HEIGHT));
window.setFramerateLimit(30);
</code></pre>

      <h2>Handling User Interaction</h2>
      <p>
        User interaction is a key part of exploring the fractal. The code
        supports panning (using the arrow keys or ZQSD) and zooming (using the A
        and E keys). When space bar is pressed, the Mandelbrot set is
        recalculated, and the texture is updated to reflect the new view.
      </p>

      <pre><code class="language-cpp">if (sf::Keyboard::isKeyPressed(sf::Keyboard::Z)) {
    view.move(0, -MOVE_SPEED * currentZoom);
}
if (sf::Keyboard::isKeyPressed(sf::Keyboard::S)) {
    view.move(0, MOVE_SPEED * currentZoom);
}
if (sf::Keyboard::isKeyPressed(sf::Keyboard::Q)) {
    view.move(-MOVE_SPEED * currentZoom, 0);
}
if (sf::Keyboard::isKeyPressed(sf::Keyboard::D)) {
    view.move(MOVE_SPEED * currentZoom, 0);
}
if (sf::Keyboard::isKeyPressed(sf::Keyboard::A)) {
    currentZoom *= 1 + ZOOM_LEVEL;
    view.zoom(1 + ZOOM_LEVEL);
}
if (sf::Keyboard::isKeyPressed(sf::Keyboard::E)) {
    currentZoom *= 1 - ZOOM_LEVEL;
    view.zoom(1 - ZOOM_LEVEL);
}
if (sf::Keyboard::isKeyPressed(sf::Keyboard::Space)) {
    centerX = (view.getCenter().x - WIDTH / 2.0) * X / WIDTH;
    centerY = (view.getCenter().y - HEIGHT / 2.0) * Y / HEIGHT;
    calculateMandelbrot(pixels, centerX, centerY, X * currentZoom,
                        Y * currentZoom);
    texture.update(pixels);
    sprite.setPosition(view.getCenter().x, view.getCenter().y);
    sprite.setScale(currentZoom, currentZoom);
}
</code></pre>

      <h2>Putting It All Together</h2>
      <p>
        The final part of the program is the main loop, which keeps the window
        open, processes user input, and redraws the fractal. The loop checks for
        events, updates the view, and ensures that the sprite representing the
        fractal is correctly positioned and scaled based on user actions.
      </p>

      <pre><code class="language-cpp">while (window.isOpen()) {
    sf::Event event;
    while (window.pollEvent(event)) {
        if (event.type == sf::Event::Closed)
            window.close();
    }

    // Update view and sprite
    window.clear();
    window.setView(view);
    window.draw(sprite);
    window.display();
}
</code></pre>
      <p>
        Don't forget to delete the pixel array after closing the window to avoid
        memory leaks:
      </p>

      <pre><code class="language-cpp">delete[] pixels;</code></pre>
      <h2>Performance Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        Calculating the Mandelbrot set is inherently computationally intensive
        because it involves performing numerous complex number operations for
        each pixel on the screen. For every pixel, the algorithm must determine
        if the corresponding point in the complex plane belongs to the
        Mandelbrot set by iterating a mathematical formula, which can be
        computationally demanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Limiting the Number of Iterations</strong><br />One of the
        primary performance optimizations is limiting the number of iterations
        (MAX_ITER). This parameter dictates how many times the formula is
        applied to check if a point escapes to infinity or remains bounded.
        While increasing MAX_ITER can improve the detail and accuracy of the
        fractal, it also increases computation time. Balancing between detail
        and performance ensures smooth real-time rendering.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Efficient Data Structures</strong><br />The pixel data is stored
        in a simple array of unsigned 8-bit integers (sf::Uint8). This approach
        is both memory-efficient and straightforward for updating pixel colors.
        Managing this data structure efficiently is crucial to ensure that
        rendering is fast and responsive.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Avoiding Unnecessary Calculations</strong><br />The Mandelbrot
        set is recalculated only when the user presses the space bar. This
        approach prevents redundant calculations during regular window updates,
        thereby conserving computational resources. By recalculating only on
        user input, the program avoids unnecessary processing, maintaining a
        smooth user experience.
